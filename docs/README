Ninja - Nagios is Now Just Awesome is a modern web gui for Nagios

Requirements
------------
Ninja requires the following system software to be installed:

php, php-mysql and php-cli 5.3+
MySQL 5+ (4 might also work but is not tested)

Further, generating stylesheets require:
ruby
sass
compass

It also requires the following software, which you can find on git.op5.org:

Nagios 4.0+ (needs to run on the same server)
Merlin
op5's livestatus
op5lib

Installation
------------
Ninja is a web application mainly written in php so in short words the
installation goes something like this

1. download, untar and put ninja in some nice place on your server
2. run make
3. configure your webserver
4. configure ninja with basic info such as where it's installed and where
   the database is located.
done :)

Here is a longer and a bit more exact version on how to install it

1. Make sure that all Ninja requirements are installed. Make sure op5lib is
   located in the global PHP path, and that both the merlin and the livestatus
   broker modules are loaded by nagios.

2. Download ninja from http://git.op5.org/

3. Copy the ninja dir to a suitable location. Will vary between installations.
mkdir /usr/local/nagios/addons/
cp -a ninja /usr/local/nagios/addons/

4. Configure your webserver. We provide an example config file for apache
   located at ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf. The example below works for
   CentOS and RedHat
vim ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf
cp ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf /etc/httpd/conf.d
service httpd restart

5. Configure Ninja. An example config file exists in ninja/op5build/index.php,
   edit the $ninja_base variable and copy it to the ninja root dir.

vim ninja/op5build/index.php

   $ninja_base = '/usr/local/nagios/addons/ninja';

cp ninja/op5build/index.php ninja/

   Edit the database connection settings and livestatus path in
   ninja/application/config/database.php
   There are more configuration files located in ninja/application/config/ but
   you should normally not require to edit them.

6. Setup the db tables required for Ninja by executing

ninja/install_scripts/ninja_db_init.sh

   This script will also try to import any existing htpasswd users from your
   Nagios config.

7. Point your browser to https://yourip/ninja and try your installation

Congratulations! You now (hopefully) have a working Ninja installation
