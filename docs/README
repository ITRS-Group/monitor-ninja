Ninja - Nagios is Now Just Awesome is a modern web gui for Nagios

Requirements
------------
Ninja requieres the following softwares to be installed:

php and php-cli 5.1.6+
MySQL 5+ (4 might also work but is not tested)
Nagios 3.0.x+ (needs to run on the same server)
Merlin

Installation
------------
Ninja is a web application mainly written in php so in short words the
installation goes something like this

1. download, untar and put ninja in some nice place on your server
2. configure your webserver
3. configure ninja with basic info such as where it's installed and where
   the database is located.
done :)

Here is a longer and a bit more exact version on how to install it

1. Make sure that all Ninja requirements are installed. In perticular Merlin
   which is a Nagios module responsible for maintaining a database with Nagios
   status, similar to the objects.cache file. For more info about Merlin,
   check out http://www.op5.org/

2. download ninja from http://www.op5.org/

3. untar
tar zxvf ninja-x.x.x.tar.gz

4. copy the ninja dir to a suitable location. Will vary between installations.
mkdir /usr/local/nagios/addons/
cp -a ninja /usr/local/nagios/addons/

5. Configure your webserver. We provide an example config file for apache
   located at ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf. The example below works for
   CentOS and RedHat
vim ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf
cp ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf /etc/httpd/conf.d
service httpd restart

6. Configure Ninja. An example config file exists in ninja/op5build/index.php,
   follow the inline comments and copy it to ninja/
vim ninja/op5build/index.php
cp ninja/op5build/index.php ninja/

7. Point your browser to https://yourip/ninja and try your installation

congratulations! you now (hopfully) have a working Ninja installation
