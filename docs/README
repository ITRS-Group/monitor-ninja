Ninja - Nagios is Now Just Awesome is a modern web gui for Nagios

Requirements
------------
Ninja requires the following system software to be installed:

php, php-mysql and php-cli 5.3+
MySQL 5+ (4 might also work but is not tested)

Further, generating stylesheets require:
ruby
sass
compass

It also requires the following software, which you can find on git.op5.org:

Nagios 4.0+ (needs to run on the same server)
Merlin
op5's livestatus
op5lib

Installation
------------
Ninja is a web application mainly written in php so in short words the
installation goes something like this

1. download op5lib, which is found in a seperate repository
2. run "make install" in op5lib
3. download, untar and put ninja in some nice place on your server
4. run make
5. configure your webserver
6. configure ninja with basic info such as where it's installed and where
   the database is located.
7. configure op5lib, such as livestatus socket connection (/etc/op5/*.yml)
done :)

Here is a longer and a bit more exact version on how to install it

1. Download op5lib from http://git.op5.org/

2. Run "make install", within the op5lib, which installs libraries used by
   ninja, both for compilation and in runtime 

3. Make sure that all Ninja requirements are installed. Make sure op5lib is
   located in the global PHP path, and that both the merlin and the livestatus
   broker modules are loaded by nagios.

4. Download ninja from http://git.op5.org/

5. Within ninja directory, type "make". In case of depenceny issues with gems
   and compass, follow the instructions in the terminal.

6. Copy the ninja dir to a suitable location. Will vary between installations.
mkdir /usr/local/nagios/addons/
cp -a ninja /usr/local/nagios/addons/

7. Configure your webserver. We provide an example config file for apache
   located at ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf. The example below works for
   CentOS and RedHat
vim ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf
cp ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf /etc/httpd/conf.d
service httpd restart

8. Configure Ninja.

   Edit the database connection settings and livestatus path in
   ninja/application/config/database.php
   There are more configuration files located in ninja/application/config/ but
   you should normally not require to edit them, the same goes for
   ninja/index.php which contains config regarding error reporting and general
   paths to Ninja's files.

9. Setup the db tables required for Ninja by executing

ninja/install_scripts/ninja_db_init.sh

   This script will also try to import any existing htpasswd users from your
   Nagios config.

10.Configure /etc/op5/*.yml files; livestatus.yml should point to your
   livestatus socket. Look at the other files so they match your system.

12.Point your browser to https://yourip/ninja and try your installation with
   default user "monitor" and password "monitor"

13.Use "op5-manage-users" to manage additional user accounts.

Congratulations! You now (hopefully) have a working Ninja installation
