Ninja - Nagios is Now Just Awesome is a modern web gui for Nagios

Requirements
------------
Ninja requieres the following softwares to be installed:

php, php-pdo and php-cli 5.1.6+
MySQL 5+ (4 might also work but is not tested)
Nagios 3.0.x+ (needs to run on the same server)
Merlin
mk_livestatus


Installation
------------
Ninja is a web application mainly written in php so in short words the
installation goes something like this

1. download, untar and put ninja in some nice place on your server
2. configure your webserver
3. configure ninja with basic info such as where it's installed and where
   the database is located.
done :)

Here is a longer and a bit more exact version on how to install it

1. Make sure that all Ninja requirements are installed. In perticular Merlin
   which is a Nagios module responsible for maintaining a database with Nagios
   status, similar to the objects.cache file. For more info about Merlin,
   check out http://www.op5.org/

2. download ninja from http://www.op5.org/

3. untar
tar zxvf ninja-x.x.x.tar.gz

4. copy the ninja dir to a suitable location. Will vary between installations.
mkdir /usr/local/nagios/addons/
cp -a ninja /usr/local/nagios/addons/

5. Configure your webserver. We provide an example config file for apache
   located at ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf. The example below works for
   CentOS and RedHat
vim ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf
cp ninja/op5build/ninja.httpd-conf /etc/httpd/conf.d
service httpd restart

6. Configure Ninja. An example config file exists in ninja/op5build/index.php,
   edit the $ninja_base variable and copy it to the ninja root dir.

vim ninja/op5build/index.php

   $ninja_base = '/usr/local/nagios/addons/ninja';

cp ninja/op5build/index.php ninja/

   Edit the database connection settings and livestatus path in
   ninja/application/config/database.php
   There are more configuration files located in ninja/application/config/ but
   you should normally not require to edit them.

7. Setup the db tables required for Ninja by executing 

ninja/install_scripts/ninja_db_init.sh

   This script will also try to import any existing htpasswd users from your
   Nagios config.

8. Point your browser to https://yourip/ninja and try your installation

congratulations! you now (hopfully) have a working Ninja installation
