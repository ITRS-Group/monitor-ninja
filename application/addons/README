This is where different custom addons should be placed.

What is addons?
Addons are small pieces of "drop-in" code that customizes the Ninja GUI without having
to edit the source files directly. By dropping your own directory with a PHP file that
does something nifty, you can add (or remove) page elements.

Example: Let's say that you would like to add a link to your intranet that should be located
in the top bar just below the Ninja logo.
By creating a directory that we call 'intranet_link' which contains a PHP file named link.php
and a javascript file called link.js, we can achieve this in a simple way.

in link.php:
	$this->xtra_js[] = 'application/addons/intranet_link/link.js';

in link.js:
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('#quicklinks').append('<ul><li id="ninja_intranet_link">Intranet.</li></ul>');
	$('#ninja_intranet_link').css('cursor', 'pointer'); // change cursor on mouse over
	$('#ninja_intranet_link').click(function() {
		top.location.href='/path/to/intranet/'; // the link
	});
});

This will make the link.js file to be included in the document header and
create a link that will point to your intranet.
