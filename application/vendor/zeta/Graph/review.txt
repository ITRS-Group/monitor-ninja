Some issues in Graph (Alexandru, 22-11-2007)
============================================

[x] If using a 3D renderer with Radar and Odometer (usually nobody does this)
    you get 2 different errors:

Radar: ezcBaseValueException: The value 'O:18:"ezcGraphRenderer3d":16:{s:19:"
       in /home/as/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Graph/src/charts/radar.php on line 165

Odometer: Fatal error: Call to undefined method ezcGraphRenderer3d::drawOdometer()
          in /home/as/dev/ezcomponents/trunk/Graph/src/charts/odometer.php on line 137

[x] ezcGraphOdometerChart has no class doc-block - most likely will end up
    in the NoPackageName section on http://ezcomponents.org/docs/api/trunk/elementindex.html
    (same with some classes in Webdav). It should also be marked as @mainclass.

[ ] Odometer chart linear gradient looks different in Flash and Svg (more green on
    the left side in Svg and almost no green in Flash, using the default palette).

	# I will open a bug for this, because this is still a general issue with
	# gradients in flash...

[x] Odometer chart does not do gradient colors in Gd (but probably this is documented).

    # GD can't draw any gradients (in a reasonable time), so yes, it is
	# documented.

[x] ezcGraphOdometerChart has some white space issues (eg. in foreach).

[x] graph_autoload.php: src/math/term.php is missing (and docanalysis.php tool does
    not work).

	# This class is not used anywhere yet, and automatically included. Removed
	# from autoload file.

[x] Some more doc block issues are revealed after running docanalysis.php.
