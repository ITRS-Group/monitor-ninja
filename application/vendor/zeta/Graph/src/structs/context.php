/**
 * Struct to represent the context of a renderer operation
 *
 * Objects of this class are passed to the renderer, so the renderer is able to
 * maintain the associations between image primitives and the datpoints. With
 * this information the renderer build the array returned by the
 * getElementReferences() method of the ezcGraphRenderer classes. In the
 * returned array the datapoints are then associated with the identifiers for
 * the image primitives returned by the respective driver.
 *
 * The ezcGraphTools class offers convience methods to handle this data and
 * enrich your charts with hyperlinks, so you don't need to handle this
 * yourself.
 *
 * The struct contains information about the $dataset and $datapoint the
 * image primitive is associated with. If the dataset or datapoint has an
 * URL associated, this URL is also available in the context struct.
