@section entrypoints Modifying Ninja's behavior

@subsection addons Using addons

Addons are small pieces of "drop-in" code that customizes the Ninja GUI without
having to edit the source files directly. By dropping your own directory with a
PHP file that does something nifty, you can add (or remove) page elements.
*Addons are located in /opt/monitor/op5/ninja/application/addons.*

Example: Let's say that you would like to add a link to your intranet that
should be located in the top bar just below the Ninja logo. We start by creating
the directory 'intranet_link' which contains a PHP file named link.php and a
javascript file called link.js.

in link.php:
@code
$this->template->js[] = 'application/addons/intranet_link/link.js';
@endcode

in link.js:
@code
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('#quicklinks')
		.append('<ul><li><a href="/path/to/intranet">Intranet</a></li></ul>');
});
@endcode

This will make the link.js file to be included in the document header and create
a link that will point to your intranet.

@subsection menu_item Add a new menu item

Copy any file in the folder application/addons/menu to your_menu_item.php. Modify
the contents (especially the URI) to suit your needs.

@subsection widget Creating your own widgets

See the documentation section on @ref Widgets.

@subsection greasy Finetuning Ninja, editing existing code

There is a "Hello World" bundle located in ninja/xdoc/demo_module_hello_world. Read
through the controller-file to grasp how you can add any code you would like to your
Ninja installation.

Coding with Ninja is to a high degree, interacting with the php framework <a
href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/">Kohana 2</a>. You can modify Ninja's behaviour
in several different layers. Before you do that, remember that the files to look
for are in /opt/monitor/op5/ninja on your Monitor server (or better yet, a test
 server).

To reuse built-in features, read the detailed method documentation of
<a href='annotated.html'>Data Structures</a>, in particular, look for classes with
names ending in _Model. These will give you the data you need to use for the next
step: coding your own solutions with Ninja as a tool to build on.

@section push Ninja is open source

Instead of keeping your changes to yourself, send an email (preferrably with a
patch) to <a href="mailto:op5-users@lists.op5.com">op5-users@lists.op5.com</a>.
If you solved a bug or came up with an idea that's good & general enough to
incorporate into Ninja itself, besides making the world better; you will be
mentioned in op5's bug tracker, git revision history, release notes and probably
get points on Ohloh and the likes, as well.
