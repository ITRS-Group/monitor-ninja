	Scenario Outline: Service object details displays state properly

		Given I have these mocked hosts
			| name     |
			| Rosalind |
		Given I have these mocked services
			| description | state   | host     |
			| Babaruajan  | <state> | Rosalind |

		Given I visit the object details page for service "Babaruajan" on host "Rosalind"
		Then I should see "Soft <text> after 0 out of 0 check attempts"

		# States that are invalid for a host result in unknown
		Examples:
			| state | text        |
			| 0     | OK          |
			| 1     | WARNING     |
			| 2     | CRITICAL    |

			| 4     | UNKNOWN     |
			| 5     | UNKNOWN     |
			| -1    | UNKNOWN     |

	Scenario Outline: Service object detail displays toggles properly

		Given I have these mocked hosts
			| name     |

			| Babaruajan  | Rosalind | 1          |

		And I visit the object details page for service "Babaruajan" on host "Rosalind"
		Then the operating status toggle "<toggle>" should be active
		And I toggle operating status "<toggle>"

		Given I visit the object details page for service "Babaruajan" on host "Rosalind"
		Then the timestamp "<label>" should show the datetime for "<value>"

		Examples:
