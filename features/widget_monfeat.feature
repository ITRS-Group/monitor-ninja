	Scenario: Monitoring features should display command links
		When I am logged in
		And I am on the main page
		And I hover over the "Dashboard options" menu
		And I hover over the "Add widget" menu
		And I click "Monitoring features"
		Then I should see "Monitoring features"
		And I should see link "Flap detection enabled"
		And I should see link "Notifications enabled"
		And I should see link "Event handlers enabled"
		And I should see link "Active Host checks enabled"
		And I should see link "Active Service checks enabled"
		And I should see link "Passive Host checks enabled"
		And I should see link "Passive Service checks enabled"
